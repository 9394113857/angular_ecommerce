🔁 FIX: MAKE A CLEAN EMPTY COMMIT (WITH DATE + CONTEXT)

Since you already pushed once, we’ll now create a properly formatted EMPTY commit to document the verified flow.

🔹 Angular Frontend — Empty Commit (Corrected Message)
git commit --allow-empty -m "Frontend(auth): register/login/logout tested locally on $(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm') | products flow pending verification"

🔹 Push It
git push origin main

✅ RESULT (What This Achieves)
•	✔ Correct timestamp included
•	✔ Clear auth flow verified
•	✔ Clear products flow pending
•	✔ Clean Git history
•	✔ No code changes needed
•	✔ Perfect for audit / team / CI/CD

Perfect thinking 👍
YES — this is exactly how professionals do it.
Feature branch first, then code, then test, then merge.

Below is clean, copy-paste ready, no extra talk.

✅ STEP 1: GO TO ANGULAR PROJECT ROOT
cd E:\ecommerce-platform\angular_ecommerce

✅ STEP 2: CHECK CURRENT BRANCH (SAFETY)
git branch


👉 Make sure you’re on main

✅ STEP 3: CREATE FEATURE BRANCH (ML EVENTS)

Use a clear, professional name:

git checkout -b feature/ml-event-tracking


✅ This does:

creates branch

switches to it

✅ STEP 4: CONFIRM YOU’RE ON FEATURE BRANCH
git branch


You should see:

* feature/ml-event-tracking
  main

✅ STEP 5: PUSH FEATURE BRANCH TO GITHUB (IMMEDIATELY)

Always push early so branch exists remotely.

git push -u origin feature/ml-event-tracking


✔ -u links local branch to remote
✔ From now on, git push is enough

🧠 WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT (REAL-WORLD RULE)

main stays stable

feature branch is safe playground

ML tracking changes won’t break production

Easy rollback if needed

Clean PR later

This is industry standard.

🟢 FROM NOW ON (IMPORTANT)

✔ All Angular ML work → feature/ml-event-tracking
❌ DO NOT code on main
